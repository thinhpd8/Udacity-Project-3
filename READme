## Project Motivation
For this project, I wanted to look at how users interact with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and give them suggestions for new articles they might like. The following tasks were divided into the project::
 - Exploratory Data Analysis
 - Rank Based Recommendations
 - User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
 - Matrix factorisation
